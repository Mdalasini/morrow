      <h2>Princess Aurelia's Diary</h2>
      <p>Another day, another suitor. They all blend together, a sea of polished armor and practiced smiles. I find myself staring out the window, wishing for a dragon to slay or a kingdom to conquer. Anything to break the <strong>monotony</strong>. <em>Is this all there is?</em></p>

      <h2>Blacksmith's Journal</h2>
      <p>The forge was hot today. I hammered out a dozen horseshoes and a fine sword for the captain of the guard. My arms ache, but there's a deep satisfaction in the weight of the hammer and the ring of steel on steel. A good day's work.</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>They can lock my body, but not my mind. I close my eyes and I am flying over the city, a bird on the wing. I see a future of shining towers and horseless carriages. One day, I will be free to build it.</p>

      <h2>Alchemist's Notes</h2>
      <p>The solution shimmers with a faint luminescence. I believe I am close to isolating the quintessence. The key, I think, is in the careful application of heat.</p>
